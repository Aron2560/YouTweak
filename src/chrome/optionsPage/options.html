                  Hi, thanks for downloading YouTweak! This extension aims to provide an improved experience for the 'heavy' subscription user, the majority of these tweaks change how you interact with your subscriptions page. If you would like automatic quality select, full buffering and many more features focused more around <i>watching</i> videos I suggest you look at one of the <a href="https://github.com/YePpHa/YouTubeCenter/wiki">many extensions</a> which already accomplish this.
                  <br><br>
                  Development on this extension is ongoing but sporadic as I have had a full time job for the past year &amp; am now returning to uni. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Mattie432/YouTweak">GitHub</a> and I welcome any bug fixes or feature suggestions you might have.
                </p>

                            <p>This feature makes it easier to delete unwanted videos from your YouTube homepage. The current YouTube layout seems to discourage the use of the 'Hide video' option previous layouts featured prominently. This feature intends to fix this, giving the user a per-video dedicated button for the removal of the video. This button instigates YouTube's own hide video feature which means that hiding it with this app also hides it if you were to sign in from a different computer without the app, however this does mean there is no way to recover a deleted video to your subscriptions page.</p>

                            <p>Enabling this feature will add an <i>'X'</i> into the bottom left of each video thumbnail on your subscriptions page. Clicking this button will remove the video.</p>

                                Please understand that this extension relies on YouTube's ability to hide videos from their homepage. From time to time, YouTube seem to 'mess up' this feature which causes videos to not be removed when the user tries to delete them. If that is the case then this feature of the extension may not function properly as YouTweak relies on this functionality. If this is the case then there is nothing which I can do to fix the extension to work &amp; the only solution is to wait for YouTube to fix it their end.

                                The functionality of removing subscription videos is currently compromised by an ongoing <strong>(*read intentional*)</strong> issue with YouTube which has been present for many since 2014. While the button to remove videos will still be present, videos older than a week may 'pop back' on page refresh &amp; refuse to be deleted. As this is a problem with YouTubes delete mechanisms there is little I can do to fix this &amp; I suggest using the <i>Collapsible Subscription Groups</i> feature to automatically collapse videos which cant be hidden.
