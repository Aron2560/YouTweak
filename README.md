## Overview
This extension aims to provide an improved experience for the popular video site, YouTube. First a little about me, I am a university student currently studying an MEng in Computer Science in the UK. I have been coding for the past 5 years and throughout that time I have been an avid creator and consumer of YouTube content. The reason for making this extension was to improve my experience when using YouTube and I have finally decided to submit this to the Chrome extension store in the hopes that it will aid you in the same way.

## Features

* #### Remove Subscription Videos
This feature makes it easier to delete unwanted videos from your YouTube homepage. The current YouTube layout seems to discourage the use of the 'Hide video' option previous layouts featured prominently. This feature intends to fix this, giving the user a per-video dedicated button for the removal of the video. This button instigates YouTube's own hide video feature which means that hiding it with this app also hides it if you were to sign in from a different computer without the app.

* #### Remove Watched Videos
This feature makes your homepage much cleaner by removing any subscription videos that you have already watched. When activated you will notice a new button added to the left navigation column of the homepage. When clicked any videos in your current subscriptions are removed.

* #### Youtube Subscriptions as Default Page
Automatically redirects you to Uploads only of your subscriptions. This changes the URL that the icon at the top left of every YouTube page links to. The default link is to "youtube.com" which shows all of your subscriptions and recommended videos mixed together. By default the app redirects to "youtube.com/feed/subscriptions" which only shows your subscriptions videos (but this can be set manually to any URL).

* #### Remove all subscription videos
This adds a button to the homepage which when clicked will cycle through all of your subscriptions and remove them, leaving you with a clean homepage ready for new subscriptions to be easily visible. (Example for use could be after returning from holiday and clearing the weeks of subscription buildup, or when a channel uploads many videos that clog-up your subscription feed)

* #### Load all subscription videos
This adds a button to the homepage which when clicked loads all of the pages of your subscriptions into view, allowing you to browse them all without having to reload the page. This can make it easier when removing videos you do not want to watch.

* #### Remove "Recommended Channels"
This removes the "Recommended Channels" box from the homepage increasing the amount of screen space used for your subscriptions by a substantial amount. This works on not only the "Uploads" feed but also the "All activity" feed making it easier to view your content.

* #### Auto like videos
This feature allows you to enter the names of channels you wish to automatically like upon watching their video

## Updates
Due to the constant changes implemented by YouTube it will be necessary to update this extension to reflect these changes. Rest assured that I am highly motivated to keep this app up to date as I am myself a fellow user.

The code for this extension is open source and will be commited to this GutHub repo whenever there is an update or a significant change has been made.

## Notes
Please understand that this extension relies on YouTube's ability to hide videos from their homepage. If for some reason the site has a problem with this feature then this extension may not function properly. If this is the case then we both have to wait for YouTube to fix their problem.
